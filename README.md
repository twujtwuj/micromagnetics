# Micromagnetics ðŸ§²

This repository includes some code I developed for my master's project entitled "Monte Carlo Micromagnetic Simulator with Checkerboard Parallelisation."

- `MMCMag` contains Python-based micormagnetic drivers
- `CPUMag` contains a C++-based CPU-parallelised micromagnetic driver
- `MMC_project.pdf` gives some background in micromagnetic simulation in the context of this project. ðŸ“š

A GPU-parallelised version of the driver in `MMCMag` using the checkerboard algorithm with PyCUDA will follow soon. ðŸš€
