This repository includes some code I used to develop my master's project entitled "Monte Carlo Micromagnetic Simulator with Checkerboard Parallelisation".

The notebook `MMC_demo.ipynb` includes a demonstration of the `MMC_driver` from the `MMCMag` package, a non-parallelised micromagnetic simulator based on Ubermag syntax that uses the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to sequentially update magnetic states. Install it with `pip install -e .`.
